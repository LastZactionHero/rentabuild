2. RENTAL AND SALE OF PRODUCTS


A. General Conditions

The Services include the rental and sale of Products. This Section 2(A) sets out terms and conditions that apply to your rental or purchase of any Product.

18 Years or Older. Products may be rented or purchased for use by individuals under 18 years of age, but we rent and sell only to adults, who may rent or purchase the Products with a payment card or other approved payment method. By clicking agreeing to these Terms, you represent that you are 18 years or older and that you are authorized to use the chosen payment method (including, without limitation, credit cards) for the purpose of renting or purchasing the Products as described in these Terms.

Limits. You acknowledge and agree that we may place limits on the rental or purchase of Products, including but not limited to restricting orders placed under a single customer account, payment card or billing or shipping address. We reserve the right to limit, cancel or prohibit any rentals or sales of Products for any reason, including but not limited to availability concerns.

Delivery. All deliveries will be through Rentabuild's shipping partners, which may change from time to time at Rentabuild's discretion. The shipping method used will be at the discretion of Rentabuild.

Collections. If you do not pay the amounts you owe to Rentabuild when due, then Rentabuild will need to institute collection procedures. You agree to pay Rentabuild costs of collection, including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees.

B. Rentals
The following additional conditions apply to the rental of any Product.

Rental Fee. The rental fee (“Rental Fee”) for the Product will be the total of the rental fee, insurance charges and delivery charges listed on the Site or App for your rental of the Product. When you place your rental order for a Product, you hereby authorize Rentabuild to charge your payment card for the Rental Fee. Rentabuild will charge your payment card the amount of the Rental Fee immediately upon your rental order. A reservation of a Product on the Site is an order for the rental of that Product, regardless of how far in advance that Product is reserved. In addition, at the time of your rental order for a Product, you hereby authorize Rentabuild to charge your payment card for an amount equal to 200% of the original retail value of the Product (when new) set forth on the Site or App (“Retail Value”) plus applicable sales taxes; provided that Rentabuild will only charge your payment card for an amount greater than the Rental Fee as described below. Rental Fees exclude all federal, state and local taxes, GST, fees, customs, duties, levies and other governmental assessments, all of which shall be paid by you directly or, if paid by Rentabuild, shall be paid by you to Rentabuild in connection with your rental order.

Cancellation Policy. You may cancel your rental order subject to the following cancellation fees and policies.
If you cancel thirty (30) or more days in advance of the delivery date, there is no cancellation fee and you will receive a full refund issued to the payment card you used for the order.
If you cancel less than thirty (30) days but more than fourteen (14) days in advance of the delivery date, you will not receive any refund, but you will receive a full credit to your Rentabuild account for the Rental Fee associated with the cancelled order. This credit can be applied to any future Rentabuild rental.
If you cancel fourteen (14) or fewer days in advance of the delivery date, you will receive a credit to your Rentabuild account for the Rental Fee associated with the cancelled order, minus a cancellation fee of $9.95.

Return of Product. With delivery of the Product, Rentabuild will provide you with a pre-paid, pre-addressed shipping return label, as well as instructions for your use in returning the Product to Rentabuild. The Products and all accessories must be returned in the original shipping packaging (‘Orignal Packaging’) including cardboard box and packing foam.

Receipt of the Products. Upon delivery, you bear responsibility for the Product(s). You acknowledge that a Secure Shipping Address is highly recommended. A “Secure Shipping Address” means a location where an individual can physically receive Product(s). In the event that an unsecure shipping address is provided, Rentabuild does not bear liability for Products left unattended. Furthermore, you acknowledge that providing anything other than a Secure Shipping Address may result in delivery delays and additional delivery fees for which Rentabuild will not be liable. You will be liable for all such delays and additional delivery fees.

Use of the Products. You agree to treat the Products with great care. You are responsible for loss, destruction or damage to the Products due to theft, mysterious disappearance, fire, other than normal wear and tear. Normal wear and tear encompasses filament clogs and scratches on the extruder nozzle. If you return a Product that is damaged beyond normal wear and tear, then you agree that we shall charge you, and you shall pay, for the price for repairing or replacing the Product, as determined in our discretion, up to the Retail Value for the Product.

Return of the Products; Extensions. You agree to return the Products to Rentabuild in the Packaging on or before the return date for the Products that are identified in the online invoice for your order. You may extend your order by phone to Rentabuild; provided that any extensions are subject to other orders for that Product and to pre-payment of the additional Rental Fee applicable to that Product for the period of time of the extension. You must return the Product by delivering the Product in the Original Packaging to a Fedex store located in the United States by 12 p.m. on or before the date that the Product is due.

Late Fees. If you return the Products late or not at all, a late fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) will be charged to the payment card you used to pay the Rental Fee or to any other payment card included in your account information that you have provided to Rentabuild for every day that you are late returning the Products, and you agree to pay such late fees, up to an amount not to exceed 200% of the Retail Value plus applicable sales tax (plus the Rental Fee). The late fee is payable for each order of Products that is not returned when due, not for each Product that is the subject of the order that is late. If you have not returned a Product within twenty (20) days after the return date for the Product, your late return will be considered a non-return and Rentabuild will charge your payment card the maximum late fee set forth in this Section 2(B), less any late fees that you have already paid, plus applicable sales tax.

Payment of 200% Rental Value. Rentabuild will not charge you for more than an amount equal to 200% of the Retail Value plus the Rental Fee, in the aggregate, for any charges arising under this Section 2(B), excluding collection costs. If you pay Rentabuild an amount equal to 200% of the Retail Value under this Section 2(B) and you still possess the Product, the Product is yours to keep, though on an “AS IS” basis without warranty of any kind. For the avoidance of doubt, the limitations of this clause shall not apply to the Rental Fee, which is charged separately from, and in addition to, any other charges payable by you pursuant to this Section 2(B).

Lost Packaging. If you lose the Original Packaging, you will be responsible for returning the item at your own expense by the expected return date, and providing Rentabuild with a tracking number. If you fail to return the Product in its original packaging, a replacement fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) will be charged to the payment card use to pay the Rental Fee or to any other payment card included in your account information that you have provided to Rentabuild.

Limited Warranties. The following are the limited warranties Rentabuild provides in connection with Product rentals.
